# HackTheBoxProject

Written as part of a Masterâ€™s program in Cybersecurity, the report offers detailed insights into the reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and privilege escalation techniques used to hack these machines.

Key highlights of the report include:

1. Introduction: Overview of the hacking process on seven machines, describing their difficulty levels 
2. Machine Walkthroughs: Each machine (Bizness, Devvortex, Codify, Analytics, Keeper, Cozy Hosting, Hospital) is analyzed through:
        -Information gathering (using tools like Nmap).
        -Vulnerability analysis and exploitation (exploiting CVEs and misconfigurations).
        -Privilege escalation to gain root access and capture flags (e.g., cracking passwords, reverse shells).
3. Tools & Techniques: Usage of tools like BurpSuite, Gobuster, and exploits of known CVEs (e.g., Apache OFBiz, Joomla, Metabase) for exploiting vulnerabilities.
4. Conclusions: Reflections on the challenges faced, learnings gained, and the overall methodology of hacking and exploiting real-world-like scenarios on Hack The Box.

This report serves as a technical walkthrough for ethical hacking, showcasing practical approaches to cybersecurity problem-solving and exploitation.
